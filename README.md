# HI3-Manga-PHP-Downloader
Very short PHP script to download books(manhua if you prefer) from the official HI3 COMIC site (https://comic.bh3.com/) and (https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/).

# TO DO
Start from a certain chapter, stop before a certain chapter, download a range of chapter or a precise chapter.

# Why?
I wrote it because i want to preserve sort a an archive of these manhuas, and if you want to know why did i choose PHP it's just because i wanted a simple language and writing this in C or C++ with cURL would be useless IMO.
